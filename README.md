## Introduction
The Transformer model has reshaped the landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP), offering state-of-the-art performance in numerous tasks. This project offers a detailed exploration and implementation of the Transformer using PyTorch, allowing for a deeper understanding of its components.

## Features
- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Central to the Transformer, enabling it to assign significance to various words in a sequence.
- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: Efficiently processes input sequences to produce desired outputs.
- **In-depth Explanations**: Each section is accompanied by detailed explanations, facilitating better understanding.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries, primarily PyTorch.
3. Execute the Jupyter notebook `PyTorch_TransformerScratch.ipynb` to walk through the Transformer's implementation.
4. Follow the step-by-step guide to understand each component of the Transformer model.
